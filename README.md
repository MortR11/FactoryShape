# FactoryShape

This is assignment that shows the use of abstract classes and inheritance to model different shapes.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: Main class to run the program.
- `CShape.java`: Abstract class representing a shape.
- `COval.java`: Class representing an oval.
- `CCircle.java`: Class representing a circle.
- `CRectangle.java`: Class representing a rectangle.
- `CSquare.java`: Class representing a square.
- `CCanvas.java`: Class representing a canvas.

## How to Run

To run the program, compile the Java files and execute the Main class.

javac Main.java CShape.java COval.java CCircle.java CRectangle.java CSquare.java CCanvas.java
java Main

## Here's an example Output this code gives
Canvas has the following random shapes:
Shape 1: SQUARE 75x75
Shape 2: SQUARE 45x45
Shape 3: RECTANGLE 22x22
Shape 4: RECTANGLE 94x41
Shape 5: SQUARE 26x26
Shape 6: RECTANGLE 54x56
Shape 7: RECTANGLE 17x45
Shape 8: CIRCLE 75
Shape 9: SQUARE 21x21
Shape 10: RECTANGLE 17x10
